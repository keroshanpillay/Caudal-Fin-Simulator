# General

"250G_Testing.ipynb" contains all of the fish simulation codes, including our earlier versions. If one wishes to analyze the simulation alone, this is the file to refer to. 

To view the optimization, run "exp.py". This will run the function defined in "fish.py". To plot the data, use "plot.py". The simulation is computationally intensive. Considering this, the data from the trials has been included in the form of csv files. These files are actually what "plot.py" uses. If you have these files, there is no need to run "exp.py". 

The figures generated from the optimization are also included for convenience.
